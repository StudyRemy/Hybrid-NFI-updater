# Hybrid-NFI-updater

Copy-pasted parts from https://github.com/krsh-off/nfi-tags-auto-update and from https://github.com/lobap/NostalgiaForInfinity_Update
which were inspired by https://github.com/shanejones/nfi-auto-update

A bash script which checks [NostalgiaForInfinityNext](https://github.com/iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity) for newly added tags and updates it for usage with the [Freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade) bot.
After updating it rebuilds and reloads the docker container.
